# Data-Structure-B1

This is a repository used along with learning data structure and algorithm from "Data Structure and Algorithm made easy", written by Narsimha Karumanchi.

The general purpose is to code along example and practice exercises from the book :)

### CH 02

- Problem: 5 \
  Find the length of connected cells of 1st(region) in a matrix of 0s and 1s.

### CH 03 -- Link List

- Problwm: 16 \
   Reverse the singly link list
- Problem: 31 \
   Merge Two sorted lists
- Problem: 32 \
   Reverse the linked list in pair
- Problem: 35 \
   Split list into two and the first split list should be at most one size longer than the second one
- Problem: 38
  Reverse every kth elements from the list.\
   For examples
  1. given a list of 0,1,2,3,4,5. If k=2,the result list would be of 1,0,3,2,5,4.
  1. given a list of 0,1,2,3,4,5. If k=3,the result list would be of 2,1,0,5,4,3.
- Problem: 40 \
   Josephus circle
- Problem: 41 \
  Clone random link list,where random link list is defined as a normal link list with next ptr plus rand ptr which randomly point to additional node.
- Problem: 43 \
  Given a link list and a pointer of a node to be deleted. Find a way to remove such node
- Problem: 44 \
  Split a list of mix numbers of even and odd so that all the even numbers go to the beginning of the list
- Problen: 46 \
  Fomd Modular node
- Problem: 47 \
  Find kth node from last
- Problem: 49 \
  Find a node from given list where its position is sqrt(n);n is a number of nodes in such list
- Problem: 53 \
  Add numbers stored in 2 lists where each node represents the digit. The most significat bit will be in left-to-right alignment. The implementation should also account for the carry-on from each digit summation.
